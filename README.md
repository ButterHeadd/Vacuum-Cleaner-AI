Just a small Uni project.
- It has 3 modes (normal, smart and smartest).
   - Normal uses a random number generator to hop around until it finds dirt.
   - Smart checks left and right to find dirt, and if there's none it just hops about randomly.
   - Smartest checks every room until it finds dirt, where it goes right to that room.
- Uses a dictionary, but I'm looking to change that to a list of some sorts.
